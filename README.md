## A crytocurrency app created for Sylo.
link to expo: https://expo.io/@ben-howard-55/Sylo
There seems to be a problem with running this on expo on IOS above version 11.4, '
as 11.4 was the version in which my ios simulator is in. 

It is best to run this using an android device.

Press on a Crypto Currency Token Card in order to be sent  a more indepth view of the currency's information. 
Press the left chevron key to return to all tokens.
There is a time scale under the app title on all screens, press on the text to change the graph time scale, 
the current scale will have its corrosponding text orange.

This App has a dark theme available.

A basic and temporary search feature has been placed into the title. (not following design / didn't have time to fully implement)
